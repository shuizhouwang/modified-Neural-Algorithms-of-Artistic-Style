#Neural Style Transformation Based on VGG_BN, Resnet-20 and Resnet-56#


1. Programming Language and Libs:
 
 - *This project is written in Python2, please verify your version of python (especially when using jupyter notebook)
 
 - *Libs used: cPickle, Tensorflow, numpy, PIL, scipy


2. Brief Intro
 This project is developed with reference to the following github projects:
  
  (1)Resnet20, Resnet56: https://github.com/xuyuwei/resnet-tf
  
  (2)VGG19: https://github.com/machrisaa/tensorflow-vgg
  
  (3)Neural-Style: https://github.com/anishathalye/neural-style 

We further implemented Neural-Style Transformation on Resnet-20 and Resnet-56 networks, as well as VGG_BN network


3. Documents

-model: pre-trained models of resnet-20, resnet-56, and VGG_BN, cifar10 dataset was used for training

-renet: neural-style transfer code for resnet-20 network, need to run training code in resnet_train first

-resnet_train: training codes for resnet-20, using cifar10 dataset.

-resnet56: neural-style transfer code for resnet-56

-resnet56_train: training codes for resnet-56, using cifar10 dataset

-vgg_trans: training and neural-style transfer code for vgg_bn network

4. How to Use

We support neural-style transfer for 3 different networks.

(1)VGG_BN
-Use Jupyter Notebook
cd vgg_trans
run vgg_bn_Script.ipynb

(2)Resnet-20 & Resnet-56
cd resnet_train (res-20) or resnet56_train (res-56)
run resnet20_Script.ipynb (res-20) or Script.ipynb (res-56)

5. Tensorboard Support for Feature Map
In resnet, resnet56, and vgg_trans, we have image_show.py document for extracting feature maps.
Simply Run Code as follow:

				python image_show.py

Then run:
				tensorboard --logdir=visual_log

And then go to tensorboard running page to obtain the feature maps
